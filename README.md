# C/C++ Questions

This is the repository where I track what I learn in C++. Syntax is the same in C and C++ unless in specific scenarios such as Header Files, Function Overloading, or Object-Oriented Programming.

> Some questions remain untouched because I can't understand how to solve them at my current level. If you know how to solve them in a beginner-friendly way, please lend a helping hand. Your contributions will help a lot of people.

## Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

- Declare an integer variable named `counter` and initialize it to 5.

### Operators

- Write a C expression using the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder when 15 is divided by 4.

### Control Structures

- Implement a C program that checks if a given number is even or odd and prints the result.

## Arrays

### One-Dimensional Array

- Declare an array of integers named `scores` with a size of 3 and initialize it with values 85, 90, and 78.

### Array Operations

- Write a C program that initializes an array of integers with values 1 to 5 and prints each element.

### Array Search

- Write a C program that searches for a specific value in an array of integers. Print the index if found; otherwise, print a message indicating its absence.

### Multi-Dimensional Array

- Declare a 2D array named `matrix` with 3 rows and 4 columns, and initialize it with some values.

- Implement a C program that uses a loop to find and print the maximum value in a matrix.

## Functions

### Basics of Functions

- Write a C function called `calculateAverage` that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the average of the elements.

- Create a function `calculateSum` that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the sum of the elements.

- Create a C program that uses the function `calculateSum` to calculate the average of an array.

- Write a C function to check if a given number is prime or not.

### Function Overloading

- In C, there is no direct support for function overloading. Discuss why function overloading is not available in C, unlike in C++.

### Recursive Function

- Implement a recursive C function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

## Pointers

### Declaration

- Declare an integer variable num and a pointer ptr to an integer. Initialize ptr to point to the address of num. Change the value of num through the pointer to 42.

### Swapping

- Write a C function called swap that takes two integer pointers as parameters and swaps the values they point to.

### Array Traversal

- Declare an array of integers and a pointer to the array. Use pointer arithmetic to print the elements of the array in reverse order.

## Challenges

- Write a C program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term using a loop.

- Modify the `calculateAverage` function from a previous example to also return the sum of the elements. Update the main function to print both average and sum.

- Create a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

- Research and implement a C function that takes a variable number of arguments and calculates their sum.
